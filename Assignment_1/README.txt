This folder contains matrices corresponding to Assignment 1 of Numerical Fluid Flow AE 227, offered in January 2025 by Prof. Aravind Balan.
This repository will provide details corresponding to NFF - TA work.

Feel free to email me at himanshukish@iisc.ac.in for any queries, I would be more than happy to help you out.


In this directory, along with the matrices for which given cases of Jacobi, GS, SGD and CG I have also provided a python script that could generate the matrices that one might want to solve using these iterative methods.
You can play around with the script and let me know in case you discover a hidden gem in Linear algebra.
